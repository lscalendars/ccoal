Calendrical calculations oriented astronomical library
=====

This library will provide a very simple API for calendar computations based on
real astronomical data, such as asian or middle-east calendars.

It is the first library of this kind, and also the first astronomical library
to fully documents its precision, on both astronomical and computer aspects.

I can take advantage of SIMD (SSE, AVX) and parallel (OpenMP) programming, to be
the fastest of its kind.

It is currently a work in progress and any help is welcome!
