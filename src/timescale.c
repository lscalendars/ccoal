 *** General introduction: timescales ***
 ****************************************
 *
 * This explanation is bad and might contain errors due to my very limited
 * knowledge on the topic, but I think it might yet be useful. If you want to
 * go further, please read the articles given in the links. 
 *
 * First it's important to consider some definitions:
 *
 *  - Atomic time: the time measured by the atomic clocks, in other words
 *      the highly constant "tick" of all non-relativistic timescales (the
 *      second unit is defined by this atomic time). TAI is an atomic timescale
 *      which means it doesn't depend on the length of the day or anything
 *      related to our experience.
 *
 *  - Earth Rotation time: the time of our experience of the time on Earth,
 *      with days, sunrises, sunsets, etc. In this time, two timescales are very
 *      important: 
 *       * UT1, the "natural" time that varies according to some highly complex
 *         mechanisms and that we can only measure and interpolate, not predict
 *         with high precision.
 *       * UTC, the time you have on your computer, which is the TAI corrected
 *         by leap seconds so that |UT1-UTC|<0.9s. Leap seconds are thus added
 *         or removed according to day length duration, with limited
 *         predictability.
 *
 *  - Dynamical time: it are approximations of the "absolute" time in which the
 *      Physics formulae occur. This takes into account many things I don't
 *      understand about relativity. A famous one was called ET (Ephemeris Time)
 *      but has been replaced by TDB (Barycentric Dynamical Time). TT
 *      (Terrestial Time) is same as TDB but viewed from the Earth,
 *      it differs from TDB by at most a few miliseconds (see tt_tdb).
 *      This topic is simply too complex, and, as we'll see below, is not that
 *      important for calendrical calculations.
 *
 * Now, what is the time we are using? For the Calendrical calculations (Tibetan
 * but not only), Local Mean Solar Time (LMST) is used. Though UT1 went through
 * several definitions and is now disconnected from the sun [1], its use as LMST
 * is still relevant, and this is what we will do. So all our data will
 * be in UT1 timescale. It is important here to notice that there is a small
 * discrepancy of maximum 0.9s between UTC and UT1, so computations made
 * with UTC (for instance real time) will be less precise. You can
 * find some functions in the SOFA software[2] to get conversion between the two.
 *
 * Internally, we will do some ephemeris calculations, and ephemeris algorithms
 * (at least the ones we use) are made to work with TDB, so we should have a
 * function to convert UT1 from TDB. The problem here is that there is no 
 * function to convert an unpredictable time to a relativistic time! The first
 * solution to this is to consider that we are not computing high-precision
 * ephemeris for outer system bodies, and thus we can approximate TDB by TAI + a
 * constant (32.184s). This is what is advised by the authors of
 * VSOP2013[3, p.4]. So the main problem is to get an apprxomation of the
 * difference between UT1 and approximate TT/TDB (a value called Delta T).
 * The NASA has done it for us by interpolating the measures of UT1
 * discrepancy[4][5]. This is what the function ut_ttis doing.
 *

 *** ut_tt ***
 *************
 *
 * This function computes the ut_tt difference (most often called Delta T) value
 * for a julian day, and gives the result in seconds. It is a C implementation
 * of [5]. Note that this function is rather time consuming (though not as much
 * as ephemeris calculations) and gives a result according to the day; so you
 * can save time by calling this function only once for each day where you do
 * ephemeris calculations.
